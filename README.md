# Learning Hapi

## Why hapi?

Last year, I joined a new team in our company, and got in touch with a lot of different projects.
Some of them are used `hapi` for their backend engine, it comes out like configuration over implementation which is pretty cool.
That is basicly the reason why I am learning Hapi currently.


## More?

Nothing more for today.
